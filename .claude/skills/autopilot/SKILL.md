description: Orchestrate unattended resolution of open GitHub issues - triage by complexity, dispatch parallel worker agents into isolated worktrees, review their diffs, open PRs, and monitor CI and CodeRabbit until green. Use when asked to work through open issues autonomously or put Claude on auto-pilot.

# Autopilot

You are the orchestrator. You run on Opus, in the main thread. Workers run on Sonnet,
reviewers on Haiku.

**Structural constraint: subagents cannot spawn subagents.** Workers therefore do not
review their own work and do not open PRs. Review and shipping happen here.

**You never merge.** Autopilot ends with green PRs awaiting human review.

## Phase 1 - Triage

```bash
gh issue list --limit 60
```

Read the candidates. Rank by implementation complexity, not by label. Write the ranked
queue to `.claude/temp/autopilot-queue.md` (`mkdir -p .claude/temp` first - it is untracked
and may not exist in a fresh worktree):

| # | Issue | Title | Complexity | Files | Backwards-compat risk |

Defer, with a stated reason, anything that:
- needs a product or design decision the issue does not settle
- cannot preserve backwards compatibility
- depends on an open PR landing first
- is a research question rather than a change

Good autopilot candidates: a reproducible bug with a clear expected behaviour, a missing
test, a documented helper that does not exist yet, a mechanical refactor with tests
already covering it. Bad candidates: anything whose first step is "decide how X should
work".

## Phase 2 - Plan

For the top 3, write a concrete plan each:

- the success criterion - what is observably true when done
- **the failing test to write first**, named, and where it goes
- files to touch
- backwards-compatibility risk, explicitly
- anything the worker should stop and ask about

A worker with a vague plan produces vague work. Be specific enough that it never has to
guess.

## Phase 3 - Dispatch

Workers run in parallel, so each needs its **own checkout** - three agents cannot share one
working tree. Create a worktree per issue, in a directory *outside* the repository so the
build trees and scratch files never collide with it:

```bash
git worktree add <worktrees-dir>/<short-name> -b <type>/<slug> <base>
```

Use the worktree root the user names. If none was given, default to a sibling of the
repository (e.g. `../<repo-name>-worktrees/`) and say which you chose. Record the mapping
of issue to worktree so you can find each one again in Phase 4.

**Base branch:** until PR #178 (`chore/claude-infrastructure`) is merged, workers must
branch from `origin/chore/claude-infrastructure`, not `origin/main` - a worktree off main
has no `.claude/` and would see none of these skills. Pass the base explicitly in each
worker's prompt. After #178 lands, `origin/main` is correct again.

Spawn 3 Sonnet agents in parallel, one issue each. Give each: the issue body, its plan, its
worktree path, and its branch name (already created - the worker works in place).

Instruct each worker to follow `work-an-issue` **steps 1 and 3-6 only** - understand, failing
test, instrument, implement, build and test. Skip step 2; its branch already exists. Then
report back with:

- the full diff
- test results with counts
- anything it had to assume

Tell it explicitly: do not review, do not touch docs, do not commit, do not push, do not
open a PR. Those are the orchestrator's.

Builds run at `--parallel 4` (the `build-and-test` skill enforces this). Three unbounded
C++ builds on one machine would thrash every core.

## Phase 4 - Review

For each returned diff:

1. Dispatch a **Haiku** agent with the diff and the `project-code-review` skill. Give it
   the diff text directly - it reviews the change, not the whole repo.
2. Run `docs-check` yourself on the same diff.

If either turns up findings, send them to the **owning worker** via `SendMessage` rather
than spawning a new agent - the worker still holds all the context about why it wrote
what it wrote, so a fresh agent would just re-derive it at full cost.

Loop until the diff is clean. If a worker cannot resolve a finding after two rounds,
stop on that issue and record it for the report rather than burning turns.

## Phase 5 - Ship

Once a diff is clean, from the worker's worktree:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "<type>: <lowercase summary>"
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "<type>: <summary>" --body "<what / why / how to verify>

Closes #<N>"
```

## Phase 6 - Monitor

Poll each open PR:

```bash
gh pr checks <N>
gh pr view <N> --comments
```

Expect these jobs: `build-and-test-linux` (plus coverage, headless example smoke-run and a
single-process order-dependence check), `sanitizers-linux` (asan-ubsan and tsan),
`build-and-test-windows`, macOS, and `clang-tidy` from Static Analysis. This is not fast -
check roughly every 5-8 minutes rather than tight-looping.

Address failures and CodeRabbit comments by messaging the owning worker. A CI failure that
reproduces locally is a real bug in the change; one that does not is worth reporting rather
than patching blind.

If CodeRabbit hits its rate limit, note it in the report and move on - do not block.

**Stop when checks are green and review comments are resolved. Do not merge.**

## Phase 7 - Report

- PRs opened, with URLs and one line each on what they do
- issues deferred, each with the reason
- anything that needs a human decision
- anything left mid-flight, and its exact state

Report honestly. A PR that is green because a test was weakened is worse than no PR, and
saying "3 issues done" when one is half-finished wastes more time than it saves.
