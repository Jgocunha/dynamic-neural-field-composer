## [2.1.2] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- File dialogs and coupling weight loaders now resolve to the correct runtime path
  (`<install-dir>/data/`) instead of the compile-time source path baked in at build time

### Build
- Example executables (`ex_*`) included in the release `bin/` folder
- `data/` folder (simulation JSONs and coupling weight files) included in the release package
- Release archive description updated to reflect new contents
